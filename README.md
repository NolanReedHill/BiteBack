## About
This project was the final class project for CS3240 Advanced Software Development. This project was completed over the course of the semester by a team of 5 students. 
## Introduction
BiteBack is a forum site centered around restaurant and food information. The goal was to create a place where users could discuss issues like menu outages, long wait times, or other common restaurant problems. Posts are made either anonymously or with an account and then reviewed by site admins to be verified. BiteBack also allows for the posting of images or PDFS to accompany a post. 
## Technology
BiteBack was built for web using Python and Django. The project was originally deployed via Heroku with a PostgreSQL database. Amazon S3 was used to store files asociated with posts. Django Bootstrap 5 was used for styling and Django AllAuth was used for user authentication.
